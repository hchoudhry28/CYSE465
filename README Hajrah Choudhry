CYSE 465 
My contribution to the Final Project was writing up 50% of the Final Report as well as assisting with our proposed attack and researching LGSVL. 
My contribution for this project included assisting my fellow group members in our attack implementation and writing about half of the final report. I first discussed what our proposed attack is, and how we planned on implementing it. I then discussed what LiDAR is, the positive aspects of LiDAR and the negative aspects of LiDAR and wrote the entire attack implementation. I included all the steps that were shown in the demonstration. Regarding my particular contribution to the final report, I would say that I did a lot of research. In addition, I spoke with Kinza Rizvi, another member of my group, and we did more study on some of the tools and technologies used in this project. Before taking any action, we had to decide how we wanted to approach this project and how we would carry it out using the essential tools and technologies. For our Final Project, we discussed everything with our other team members, Luke, David, and Viren, to make sure we were all on the same page. In terms of my own study, I looked at how light sent from a source vehicle may transfer light data to a destination vehicle in the same way that light data is designed to be acquired. I found it fascinating that some people could think of giving the information at some unspecified time after the first transmission if it fails as a potential solution to the issue. However, if numerous devices cooperate to consistently transmit information, a lot of time will have already passed. Instead, autonomy favors real-time data analysis (or as near to it as is practical) to carry out tasks like slowing down if the automobile in front of you suddenly halted. Overall, I conducted research for this project as well as typing out the bulk of the report above.
